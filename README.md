# Welcome to my New Testament Authorship Attribution project!

Right now, this project consists only of my summer 2020 seminar paper, together with some additional files:

- An RScript with some experimental R code playing around with the Greek text of the New Testament
- An excel sheet with a step-by-step calculation of how to calculate different Deltas between documents

The seminar paper is kind of a white paper explaining core concepts of authorship attribution and Machine Learning, and what has been done in this regard with the New Testament. 

More might be growing out of this, so stay tuned...
