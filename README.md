# Welcome to my New Testament Authorship Attribution project!

Which of the Paulinian letters were actually written by the Apostle Paul? The present study reveals that on grounds of Machine Learning (which can be thought of as sophisticated application of statistics of word frequencies), there are good reasons to consider the Apostle as the real author behind most of the contested letters. Curious? Read the paper, and look at the plots!

- The seminar paper is kind of a white paper explaining core concepts of authorship attribution and Machine Learning, and what has been done in this regard with the New Testament
- An excel sheet with a step-by-step explanation of how to calculate different Deltas between documents.
- 01_Data: The original files (see copyright notes below), and the slices/portions to analyse, subdivided into
  - Training_Data, and
  - Test_Data
- 02_Script: The R-Scripts needed to reproduce this analysis. Based on the General Impostor's framework as implemented in the R-package `stylo()` (https://cran.r-project.org/package=stylo)
  - 1 Preprocessing: Extract features (text properties, e.g. frequencies of words) from the text
  - 2 Hyperparameter and feature tuning: Create combinations of hyperparameters (e.g. distance measure) and features, and perform a grid search for the best combinations. Among the hundreds of combinations tested, 46 are likely to yield statistically significant results.
  - 3 Analysis with the Imposters Method of `stylo()`
  - 4 Create boxplots in order to visualize the results
- 03_Output
  - Data: Intermediate steps of the data processing (RData, csv)
  - Plots: The actual results of this work, estimates of probability for the authorship of 10 passages of the New Testament



Reading help for 1Timothy: For every of the five candidates, there were 46 estimates of probability that this candidate wrote 1Timothy. This is due to the 46 combinations of features and hyperparameters. For Paul, the median of the estimates is a bit lower than 0.8. The grey box represents 50% of the data points, and the "whiskers" the entire range of the data points - with exception of outliers, which are separately displayed as small circles.
